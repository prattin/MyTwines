[[Lion]]
[[Cheetah]]
[[Giraffe]]
[[Penguin]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Lion" tags="" position="421,9">You are the strongest animal in the savannah, your name is Lando. Your sheer power is enough to make the strongest men cower in fear. You see a tourist group on a safari. They look and smell delicious. What do you do?

[[Eat them]]
[[Steal one of the children and bring it back to your den]]
[[Perform a juggling act]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Cheetah" tags="" position="831,95">Your name is Chester the Cheetah and ever since you were a young boy you liked to have a good time. You discover your parents are going away for the weekend. This would be the perfect opportunity to throw a party. You&#x27;ve been waiting for an opportunity like this for awhile. You invite all your closest friends you know from the watering hole. What kind of party do you want to have.

[[A rager]]
[[A small get together]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Giraffe" tags="" position="1339,83">You probably chose giraffe because they were your favorite animal at the zoo. They seem so [[innocent...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Eat them" tags="" position="296,55">You sneak up behind the jeep... You notice that there are three men, 4 women and a child. These people will be plenty enough to share with the lioness you are trying to impress. But, you skipped lunch today and could easily eat as much as you want and take home the leftovers. What do you do?

[[You get distracted by the exhaust pipe and try to taste the smoke coming out of it]]
[[You decide not to share and eat them all right there]]
[[You eat as much as you can and get a to-go box for the left-overs]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Steal one of the children and bring it back to your den" tags="" position="422,134">You sneak behind the jeep...You notice the tourists are distracted by a couple of gazelles in the distance. You hop on the back of the truck and quietly take the baby out of his carriage. You sling the child on your back and run off into the distance. By the time the tourists notice their child has been snatched by a 2,000 pound lion, the beast has already vanished.
You return to your den, what do you do with the child?

[[Cook him up in a nice stew]]
[[Raise him as if he was your own cub]]
[[Return him to the tourist]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Perform a juggling act" tags="" position="553,102">That&#x27;s just stupid.

[[Go Back-&gt;Lion]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Cook him up in a nice stew" tags="" position="397,413">You are excited to try out your grandmother&#x27;s home-made stew recipe and gather all the ingredients before the big meal. You get a large pot of water over the fire and wait for it to boil. You then put in the extra ingredients: leaves, rabbit feet, and antelope horns. Once those are in, you put in the main meat source, the young tourists. You figure he will take awhile to cook so you decide to rest your eyes for a bit. You wake 40 minutes later and frantically run to the stove in hopes you didn&#x27;t burn the stew. When you get to the pot you realize you badly overcooked the stew and your potentially deliciouus meal is ruined and you resort to eating dirt.

[[Go back-&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Raise him as if he was your own cub" tags="" position="520,416">After just a few hours with the boy you begin to grow attached to him. You love playing with him because he is so full of energy. He loves to wrestle and play with your hair. Over several days you build a strong bond for the boy as if he was your own cub. You take the boy to your favorite place in the savannah, your local watering hole. You and the boy walk along the edge of the water kicking rocks and scaring zebras. The boy sees something in the water and he runs into the water to see what it is. He tries to pull it to shore but he is not strong enough, so you help him. Once you get it to shore, you realize it is the lioness you&#x27;ve had a crush on since you were a kid...You are terrified. How did this happen? Did she drowned? You quickly call over Guillermo the Giraffe who just graduated with his doctorate to take a look at the young lioness.She appears to have drowned. &quot;How is this possible? She won gold in the butterfly stroke at the last African Olympics&quot; Guillermo says with a tear in his eye, &quot;She&#x27;s been murdered...&quot;
[[You promise to find the killer if it&#x27;s the last thing you do]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Return him to the tourist" tags="" position="645,410">The child quickly begins to annoy you by constantly pulling your hair and picking your nose. You cannot take it anymore and decide to return the child back to the tourist group. It takes you awhile to locate the Jeep because they were looking so frantically for the child. Once the driver sees you, the tourists start crying, worrying that you hurt the child. As they get closer they are relieved the child is unharmed. They are still terrified as they try to keep you calm and grab the baby from your back. They are so happy with the return of the baby they almost completely forget you are there. You are nervous they will be mad at you for stealing their baby, but it does not appear they are. The driver turns on the jeep and they begin to turn around. You are relieved to know that they are not mad at you and you can go back to your normal lion life. Right as you begin to head back to your den, you hear the cocking of a gun as the tour guide in the back seat puts two bullets in the back of your head without hesitation.

You&#x27;ve never been so full in your life. You can&#x27;t remember a tastier batch of tourists. After finishing the last tourist, you slip into a food coma. Your eyes get heavy and you decide to take a [[nap]] on the jeep for a few minutes to regain your strength. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="You eat as much as you can and get a to-go box for the left-overs" tags="" position="142,133">The lioness appreciates your nice gesture. This sparks a romantic moment between you and the young lioness. You ask her on a date. She says yes. Where do you take her?

[[The Local Watering Hole]]
[[A party at your friend Chester Cheetah&#x27;s lair]]
[[A nice romantic evening in the elephant graveyard]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="The Local Watering Hole" tags="" position="4,297">As you and the lioness stroll along a watering hole near your den and the both of you are really begin to connect. You discover that your parents all went to the same hunting school and that you both prefer antelope more than wildebeest. You excuse yourself for a moment to use the restroom because your earlier tourist meal is not sitting well with you. You soon return. The lioness is gone. Where did she go?

[[Maybe she went for a swim?]]
[[Maybe she went to chase a meerkat?]]
[[Maybe she hated the date so much she bailed?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="A party at your friend Chester Cheetah&#x27;s lair" tags="" position="6,140">Your friend Chester overdoses on Hippo Blubber and a potentially fun evening turns into a traumatic one.

[[Go Back-&gt;The Local Watering Hole]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="A nice romantic evening in the elephant graveyard" tags="" position="147,269">You really out-did yourself this time. You got reservations at the nicest table in the elephant graveyard. You&#x27;re having a delicious meal of zebra ribs and mashed bone marrow. The waitor comes over and asks, &quot;Are we celebrating anything special tonight?&quot; You reply, &quot;We are actually... We are celebrating a chance at love.&quot; The lioness giggles and begins to blush. After you both finish your delicious meal, neither of you want the date to end. [[Go walk around the watering hole.-&gt;The Local Watering Hole]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Maybe she went for a swim?" tags="" position="9,553">Seems unlikely...And you just got your mane blow-dryied.

You slip into a deep depression. You will never find love again. You eventually commit suicide by jumping in the middle of a stampede of wildebeest.

[[Go Back-&gt;Maybe she went for a swim?]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="Yes, she could very well be the love of my life" tags="" position="145,558">You gather a search party at the watering hole of all the animals that drink there. They search up and down the watering hole looking for the lioness. You see your friend Horacio Hyena come out of the water dragging something. It was her. She didn&#x27;t appear to be breathing.You call over Guillermo the Giraffe who just graduated with his doctorate to take a look at the young lioness.She appears to have drowned. &quot;How is this possible? She won gold in the butterfly stroke at the last African Olympics&quot; Guillermo says with a tear in his eye, &quot;She&#x27;s been murdered...&quot; How do you react?

You take all your dates to the same bar. The owner knows your name and expects you to be at the club every Saturday night. You go through the same routine each week. Show off your dance moves to her, get her a little tipsy, and take her back to your den. After your most recent date you begin feeling ill. You haven&#x27;t been sick in years, so it is very odd you are feeling this way. [[Go see doctor Guillermo]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="You mourn her loss" tags="" position="329,734">Crying is uncommon for a lion, but you are not afraid to show your emotions towards the lioness&#x27; death.

You return to your den and pick your favorite rock to sleep on. You had a very long, stressful day and fall asleep almost immediately. You dream about all the great places you would&#x27;ve taken the lioness. The dream ends suddenly and the next morning the police find you dead on your rock bed. They found large amount of hippo blubber in your stomach...[[Find out what happened to him-&gt;Murder at the Watering Hole]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Penguin" tags="" position="1098,60">If you&#x27;re reading this, that means you chose to be an African penguin. I hope, after reading this, you learn that African penguins do not exist...

[[Go Back-&gt;Murder at the Watering Hole]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="A rager" tags="" position="696,0">Your party gets out of control. Your friends brought their friends who brought their friends. Soon enough you had the whole watering hole at your parents&#x27; house. You see your friend Lando the lion talking to a beautiful lioness you&#x27;ve had a crush on since the day you moved here. You quickly become very sad because you know you could never stand a chance if she flirting talking to Lando. You head into the bathroom to cry for a few minutes, but you see Horacio the hyena and some zebra you didn&#x27;t know smoking some rare hippo blubber they bought from a friend. At first you are mad at them for doing hard drugs in your house, but then you remember the way the lioness looked at Lando. The zebra offers you some of his hippo blubber already rolled up nicely in a leaf. You hesitate for a moment, but decide to let loose and hope it will help you forget about the lioness....

[[You take a hit]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="A small get together" tags="" position="956,0">Your party turns out lame. You become nervous your parents will find out about it and you poop in the middle of the dance floor and you become the laughing stock of the watering hole and can never show your face there again.

[[Go Back-&gt;Cheetah]] 

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="You take a hit" tags="" position="704,135">You take the blubber from the zebra and light it. You love the sense of euphoria you get from it. The lioness was completely out of your mind. You stop at one and go back into the party. As you&#x27;re leaving the bathroom you see Lando leading the lioness to an upstairs bedroom. How could she do this to you? All those poems and flowers you sent to her....for nothing! This blubber wasn&#x27;t working you were still thinking about her. You turn around and go back into the bathroom. You look at the zebra and say, [[&quot;You know what? I will have another hit.&quot;]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="&quot;You know what? I will have another hit.&quot;" tags="" position="705,285">You take the blubber from the zebra again. You light it and breathe it in. Why isn&#x27;t it working? You were still thinking about her. You take two more in hopes that it will eventually kick in. After the fourth hit, Horacio the hyena looks at you telling you to slow down. You don&#x27;t listen. You take two more. Now it was finally working. You were no longer thinking of her, you were no longer thinking of anything for that matter...Lights and sounds begin to blend together. Up is down, down is sideways and you start to get dizzy. You lose all feeling in your muscles as you fall to the floor. The last thing you see as your eyes close is the lioness screaming for someone to call the doctor. You did it! You kept the lioness from Lando&#x27;s seductive clutches. One eye shuts and the second follows behind it. Foam begins to come out the side of your mouth as you&#x27;re gasping for your last breathes of air, until you no longer need it... The police diagnose your death as hippo blubber overdose. Few attend your funeral. The lioness says a few nice words, but you are soon forgotten.  

[[Wow I regret picking Cheetah-&gt;Murder at the Watering Hole]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="nap" tags="" position="272,346">After about ten minutes after falling asleep, a band of poachers drive past. They almost go right past without noticing you, but the driver catches a glimpse of you out of the corner of his eye. He stops the truck and they haul you into the back of the trailer after a few well-placed tranquilizer shots. They bring you back to their hut that they constructed in the brush and you slowly are skinned alive. After just a few weeks, you now reside in a nice 3-bedroom apartment with a family of four in Baltimore, Maryland. The good news is you see them everyday before they leave for work and school. The bad news is that... you are their new living room rug.

[[Go back-&gt;Eat them]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="Go see doctor Guillermo" tags="" position="92,818">You get to doctor Guillermo the giraffe&#x27;s office and he takes a look at you. He runs serveral tests to try and determine the cause of your illness. He steps out for a few moments to get the test results. You&#x27;re very nervous. What if you  have the flu like your father had? Or maybe even the chicken pox? The doctor returns to the room and says, &quot;Lando, I&#x27;m sorry to tell you this but you have a lion STD.&quot; You are shocked and horrified by the news. You immediately regret all your poor decisions you made in the past and wish you could start over. The illness slowly consumes you and you die a month later. [[Wow that was depressing, go back-&gt;Yes, she could very well be the love of my life]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="innocent..." tags="" position="1339,233">This specific giraffe, however, had [[anger]] in his heart </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="anger" tags="" position="1339,383">It all started on the night of Chester Cheetah&#x27;s party. You been in love with the lioness that has lived across the savannah from you your whole life. You knew she would be at Chester&#x27;s that night, but he must&#x27;ve forgotten to give you an invitation. You had to get to that party to make sure you kept other guys away from her. You needed a [[gameplan]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="gameplan" tags="" position="1339,533">There are two realistic suitors for the fair maiden and they are Chester cheetah himself and Lando lion. Who will you sabotage?

[[Lando]]
[[Chester]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="Lando" tags="" position="1254,658">Are you nuts? Have you never seen a lion hunt his prey? They are pure muscle. You would not stand a chance against Lando.

[[Go back-&gt;gameplan]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="Chester" tags="" position="1486,666">Good choice, while Chester could be a ferocious predator, he is too dumb for his own good. He would be the perfect target. Ever since you were a young giraffe, Chester was very easily persuaded by people. All he would need is a little convincing from a friend to get him to make a [[mistake...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name="mistake..." tags="" position="1486,816">What did you know about Chester? You know that like yourself and the rest of the watering hole, he has been in love with the lioness for as long as you can remember. That was what always kept you and Chester from becoming close. You could finally use his love for the lioness [[against him.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name="against him." tags="" position="1486,966">Once your idea is fully formed, you wait for the night of Chester&#x27;s party so that you can put your all your scheming to use. Before the party, you meet up with Horacio Hyena and give him a gift of rare Hippo Blubber to smoke at the party. You stole the blubber from your older brother and you&#x27;re expecting to get your ass kicked when you get back home. Hopefully, the ass kicking will be worth it. You tell him, &quot;All you have to do is offer some blubber to Chester once he goes into the bathroom.&quot; Horacio agrees with your terms and he enters the party. The plan was all falling into place. Now all you had to do was talk to Lando. You hid in the brush and waited for him to get to Chester&#x27;s. He already arrived with the lioness which was very surprising to you. You never knew they were that close. You call him over before he goes inside and you tell him how the lioness had nothing but good things to say about him and how she thought he was cute. That was all Lando needed to spark his ego and approach the lioness with loads of confidence. After laying down all the groundwork, you just sit back and watch it all unfold through a window in the the ceiling of Chester&#x27;s place. Lando and the lioness were really hitting it off at the party and it was only a matter of time before Chester noticed. You wait a few minutes and you see Chester head into the [[bathroom]] where you knew Horacio was at. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="bathroom" tags="" position="1486,1116">You go take a break knowing that Horacio will take care of the rest. You go take a stroll to the watering hole to relax assuming the plan all worked out. You decide to go for a swim and soak out all the bad juju from your long giraffe neck. You hear two voices approaching. It was Lando and the lioness. They both seemed pretty upset. You didn&#x27;t want anyone seeing you washing away all your filth in the drinking water so you go underwater when they approach. You begin to panic as they walk along the shoreline. You are not sure how much longer you could hold your breathe. Then, all of sudden Lando leaves the scene. Where was he going without the lioness? You decide to come up for air and the lioness immdediately hears you gasping. &quot;Guillermo? Is that you?&quot; said the lioness. Shit, she saw you. Nows your chance to tell her how you feel before Lando can get to her. You quickly tell her about how you think about her constantly and how she&#x27;s the only girl you&#x27;ve ever loved. She loves what you&#x27;re saying and starts blushing. After you tell her how you feel, she stays silent for a few moments. She looks at you and hesitates. She slowly walks into the water and jumps into your arms as you embrace her with your lips. You kiss for a few seconds and it was everything you ever imagined; you never want it to end. After about a minute she stops and says, &quot;Guillermo I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t do this to Lando.&quot; You are devastated as she begins to walk away. You quickly get angry. What does Lando have that I don&#x27;t? You are enraged at the thought of them together and you snap. [[You grab her by the foot and pull her back]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="You grab her by the foot and pull her back" tags="" position="1611,669">Your emotions get the best of you and you drag her through the water until you get to the deep area of the water. You hold her head down as she squirms. You look the other way as she stops moving completely. You had to do it. If you couldn&#x27;t have her, no one can. You quickly hide the body in the reeds in the water and hide waiting for Lando to come back. He returns looking everywhere for the lioness. He gathers a search party to look for her and it wasn&#x27;t until Horacio hyena went into the water that they noticed her body. You begin to panic and they call you over to take a look at the body. You continue to panic and tell everyone she has been murdered. Lando swears he will find who did this and you&#x27;re confident he will find out you did it. [[You had to get rid of him.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="You had to get rid of him." tags="" position="1645,825">You waited until midnight, after everyone had gone home mourning the loss. You sneak over to Lando&#x27;s den. It is disgusting, does he ever clean this place? You tip-toe to the rock Lando was laying on and you shove the remaining hippo blubber you had down Lando&#x27;s throat. He peacefully dies in his sleep as the drugs poison his body. The community found out the next day with no leads as to who could have done this. You fixed the problem and left no evidence that could prove your guilt. You are able to go back to your daily life without having to worry about Chester, the lioness, and Lando. You were finally at peace.
